#### Problem Statement
<p>The process of assessing and validating insurance claims for damaged car outer body parts is often time-consuming, manual, and subjective. Insurance companies face challenges in accurately detecting and evaluating the extent of damage, leading to potential discrepancies, delays, and customer dissatisfaction. Therefore, there is a need to develop an automated computer vision system that can accurately detect and classify damaged car outer body parts, enabling insurance companies to streamline their claims processing workflow and enhance customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>The main problems to be addressed in this project include:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Inaccurate detection: The current manual inspection process for damaged car outer body parts can be subjective and prone to human error, resulting in inaccurate assessments. An automated system is required to improve the accuracy of damage detection, ensuring a fair evaluation of insurance claims.</li>
    <li>Inefficient claims processing: Manual assessment of damaged car outer body parts is time-consuming, leading to delays in claim settlements and increased operational costs for insurance companies. An automated solution would enable faster and more efficient claims processing, reducing the time and resources required for evaluation.</li>
    <li>Lack of standardization: The absence of standardized procedures and guidelines for assessing damaged car outer body parts can lead to inconsistencies in claim evaluations. Developing a computer vision system that follows standardized protocols would ensure consistent and fair assessments across different insurance claims.</li>
    <li>Variability in car models and damage types: Car models and designs vary significantly, and damage can manifest in different ways, making it challenging to develop a universal system that can accurately detect various types of damage across different vehicle types. The system needs to address this variability and accommodate a wide range of car models and damage scenarios.</li>    
</ol>
